# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on freeCodeCamp. I thought it was better to start off from the very beginning.

Forgot to make the commit to the git repository for this log.

**Thoughts:** I already know the basics of this and part of me just wants to skip to the fun stuff. I need to take those thoughts and move past that. A strong foundation is really what I'd like to have.
